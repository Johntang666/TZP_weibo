## **Donald Trump’s gift to Vladimir Putin**

>  唐纳德·特朗普送给弗拉基米尔·普京的“礼物”

**Russia’s leader is honoured, but offers little in return**
 俄罗斯领导人备受礼遇，但回报寥寥

------

FROM THE moment he stepped off his plane onto the **red-carpeted tarmac**, Vladimir Putin’s trip to Alaska was a triumph. He was greeted with applause from his host, Donald Trump. The two men may have had nothing to announce after hours of talks—the first **encounter** between a Russian and American president since the invasion of Ukraine—but the meeting at the Elmendorf-Richardson **military base** in Anchorage transformed Mr Putin from a **pariah** of the West into an **honoured guest** on American soil.
 自普京踏上**红地毯停机坪**的那一刻起，他的阿拉斯加之行就堪称凯旋。东道主唐纳德·特朗普以掌声相迎。尽管这场持续数小时的会谈——自乌克兰战事爆发以来俄美总统的首次**会晤**——并无实质发布，但在安克雷奇埃尔门多夫-理查森**军事基地**的这一幕，已把普京从西方的**弃儿**转变为美国土地上的**受礼遇的贵宾**。

------

“There is no deal until there is a deal,” declared a glum Mr Trump. He claimed there had been “many, many points that we agreed on”, but not on the central question of halting the war in Ukraine. It is a sign of the times that such failure may be a relief for Ukrainian and European leaders, who feared that Mr Trump would **yield to** Mr Putin’s demands to neuter Ukraine. Mercifully, Mr Trump did not repeat his earlier talk of “**land swaps**”.
 “在真正达成协议之前，就没有协议。”特朗普面色阴郁地说道。他声称双方“在许多、许多议题上达成了一致”，但在停止乌克兰战争这一核心问题上并无共识。耐人寻味的是，这样的无果反而令乌欧领导人松了口气——他们担心特朗普会**屈从于**普京削弱乌克兰的要求。所幸，特朗普未再提他先前谈论的“**领土交换**”。

------

The two leaders took no questions. Perhaps Mr Trump knew he would be asked about his **pre-summit** threats of “very severe consequences” if Russia did not end the conflict. Just before landing Mr Trump had told Fox News: “I won’t be happy if I walk away without some form of **ceasefire**.” There was no immediate sign of a three-way summit with the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, that Mr Trump had previously floated. Nor was there a glint of a **nuclear-arms-control deal**, which Mr Putin had suggested. Both spoke about economic opportunities, but there was little that was **tangible**. Mr Trump said he would brief Mr Zelensky and European leaders, which may yield more indications of what happened.
 两位领导人没有回答记者提问。或许特朗普心知肚明——他会被追问**会前**放话称若俄方不止战将遭遇“极其严厉后果”。在专机落地前，他还对福克斯新闻表示：“如果谈不出某种**停火**框架，我不会满意。”他先前提及的与乌克兰总统泽连斯基举行三方峰会，并无迹象将马上成行；普京提出的**核军控协议**也未见眉目。两人都谈到了经贸机遇，却鲜有**实质性**收获。特朗普称将向泽连斯基及欧洲领导人通报，会后细节或许因此更为明晰。

------

Ever the **showman**, Mr Trump took care to impress Mr Putin. Their planes parked close to each other; the two men stepped out more or less simultaneously, shook hands warmly and walked towards a podium as a B-2 bomber, escorted by four F-35 fighters, passed overhead. Four F-22s on the ground formed a **guard of honour**. Mr Trump may have wanted to demonstrate America’s military power. Instead, he displayed its **diplomatic weakness**—having repeatedly set deadlines for Russia to **ceasefire**, then done nothing when they were ignored.
 一如既往地善于作秀，这位**善于作秀的人**刻意营造震撼：两架专机并排停放，两人几乎同时走下舷梯，热情握手步向讲台，头顶掠过一架B-2轰炸机与四架F-35护航机；地面四架F-22列队成**荣誉护卫队**。特朗普或许想展示美国军力，然而暴露的却是**外交弱势**——多次给俄罗斯设定**停火**期限，却在对方置之不理时无所作为。

------

It was a notable display, if only because the F-22 is America’s most capable fighter and remains protected from **prying eyes**. When your correspondent saw some of the jets from the same Alaskan wing on exercise in Tinian, thousands of miles away in the central Pacific, he had to submit all photographs for **censorship** by the US Air Force. The Russian delegation no doubt took every opportunity to scrutinise them as the motorcade made its way down the flight line.
 这一幕颇为引人注目，仅仅因为F-22是美国最强的战机，平日严防外界**窥视的目光**。本刊记者曾在中太平洋的天宁岛远观同一阿拉斯加联队的演训，当时所有照片都必须提交美空军进行**审查**。毫无疑问，俄方代表团在车队沿跑道行进时把握每个细节端详的机会。

------

In his first term Mr Trump often liked to speak to Mr Putin alone, without officials or note-takers. It was a relief, therefore, when it was announced earlier in the day that the planned **one-on-one** meeting in Anchorage had been expanded to include two other senior officials on each side. But as they stepped off the podium, Mr Trump invited Mr Putin to get into his limousine, known as “**the Beast**”—securing the private chat after all.
 在第一任期内，特朗普常爱与普京单独交谈，不带官员与记录员。因此，当天稍早宣布安克雷奇原定的**一对一**会面扩充为双方各加两名高官，多少令人松口气。然而走下讲台时，特朗普又请普京登上他的座驾“**野兽**”，私下交谈终究还是成了。

------

The honours for Mr Putin were in sharp contrast to the **public humiliation** that Mr Trump and his advisers inflicted on Mr Zelensky during his visit to the White House earlier this year. Since then relations with Ukraine have improved, but Mr Trump has often been quick to blame it for being invaded; and he has proved strangely indulgent with Mr Putin. Mr Trump told Fox you have to “weave and bob” to reach deals, but his constant shuffling in the run-up to the summit suggests **indecision** and frustration with a Russian leader who will not respond to his entreaties.
 对普京的礼遇，与今年早些时候泽连斯基到访白宫时特朗普及其顾问施加的**公开羞辱**形成鲜明对照。此后美乌关系虽有起色，但特朗普仍时不时把被侵略的责任归咎于乌方；对普京却颇为宽纵。他对福克斯称，达成协议需要“进退腾挪”，但在峰会前反复变卦，更像**举棋不定**与对这位不理会劝告的俄方领导人的沮丧。

------

The Alaskan venue was rife with **symbolism**: the proximity of Russia and America across the **Bering Strait**, the sale of Alaska by Tsarist Russia to the United States in 1867; and the American **lend-lease** agreements that armed the Soviet Union to help it resist Nazi Germany (an important supply route ran through Alaska). Mr Putin recalled all this and recounted how, on the red carpet, he had greeted Mr Trump with “Good afternoon, dear neighbour.”
 阿拉斯加这一选址**象征意味**浓厚：俄美隔**白令海峡**相望；1867年沙俄将阿拉斯加售予美国；以及美国通过**租借**法案武装苏联、助其抗击纳粹德国（重要补给线贯穿阿拉斯加）。普京一一追述，并提到他在红毯上向特朗普问候：“午安，亲爱的邻居。”

------

It surely makes sense for big nuclear powers, even geopolitical rivals, to talk to each other. Whether they need to roll out the honours at home for no gain is more doubtful. The only **sop** to Mr Trump came when the Russian leader said he was “sincerely interested in putting an end” to the war, and agreed that it would not have happened had Mr Trump been president in 2022.
 对拥有核武的大国而言，即便地缘上彼此为对手，对话自有其道理。但在本土大张旗鼓行礼而无所得，则更令人疑虑。能稍稍安抚特朗普的，恐怕只有这点**安抚性让步**：俄方领袖称自己“真诚希望结束”战争，并表示若2022年特朗普在任，战争或许不会发生。

------

Yet Mr Putin insisted that “we need to eliminate all the primary causes of that conflict”. Given that he thinks the primary cause is Ukraine’s independence and **sovereignty**, and its right to join European institutions including NATO, his formula is a recipe for continuing the war. Mr Trump did nothing to **disabuse** him. The Russian president left with a smile, and even tried a little English in public: “Next time in Moscow”, he told his host. To which Mr Trump replied, “I’ll get a little heat on that one, but I could see it possibly happening.”
 然而普京坚持称“我们需要消除这场冲突的一切根源”。若考虑到他所认定的“根源”是乌克兰的独立与**主权**，以及其加入包括北约在内的欧洲机构的权利，那么这种说法无异于续战之方。特朗普并未出手**纠正**其看法。俄总统笑着离去，且在公众场合秀了句英文：“下次莫斯科见。”特朗普回应道：“这话会让我挨点儿骂，但也不是没可能。”

# 2) 词汇记忆小故事（80–100词）

On a **red-carpeted tarmac**, the staged **triumph** began: a high-profile **encounter** at a US **military base**, with a jet **guard of honour** shielding hardware from **prying eyes** and **censorship**. Allies feared he’d **yield to** talk of **land swaps**, yet no **ceasefire** or **nuclear-arms-control deal** emerged—only **symbolism**, little **tangible** progress, and growing signs of **indecision**. The ex-**pariah** looked every inch the **honoured guest**, while a planned **one-on-one** morphed into a private chat. Questioning Ukraine’s **sovereignty**, he left smiling; no one moved to **disabuse** him.

# 7) 一页提要（≤100字）

阿拉斯加礼遇“洗白”普京：排场足、收获少；停火、军控皆无进展。象征压倒实质，盟友防“让步”。对乌态度强硬、对俄宽纵，流露犹疑。未纠偏对方将主权视为“根因”的叙事，续战风险在。
